# Empty State Spinner

So usually when i see people talk about spinners i see people hating on them. I actually quite enjoy
the built in spinner. The only feature i was missing was an initial empty state for the spinner.

So this is my attempt at not re-inventing the spinner but rather extending it with an initial
(optional) empty state.

## Get it

```groovy

implementation 'org.grunkspin:empty-state-spinner:0.1'

```

Currently you also have to add a maven repo since im waiting for jcenter approval.

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/540grunkspin/EmptyStateSpinner' }
    }
}
```

## Usage

This is an example of how to use the spinner:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var spinner: EmptyStateSpinner
    private val options = arrayListOf("Option one", "Option two", "Option three")
    

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        spinner = findViewById(R.id.spinner)
        val adapter = ArrayAdapter<String>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, options)
        spinner.setAdapter(adapter, "Empty")
    }
}
```

As you can se the only addition to using a regular spinner is that the *setAdapter* method now has
and additional empty state. The empty state can be anything as long as it matches the type of the
*ArrayAdapter*.

**IMPORTANT** The underlying list in the array adapter has to be a list that supports removing and
inserting elements. So if you use something like *listOf* instead of *arrayListOf* the *setAdapter*
method will throw an *UnsupportedOperationException*.

Feel free to contribute and submit pull requests. There are currently only Instrumentation tests for
the spinner.

If you don't want to contribute at all but just use it please feel free to do so.
